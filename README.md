# MarkBook-Console
MarkBook application built with C# for console

This is a MarkBook I built with C# for a grade 12 Computer Science assignment. This program runs on console. You can add students, which then places all their data in a file called "page.txt".
You can also find the students that you added and also delete them (will be added later).

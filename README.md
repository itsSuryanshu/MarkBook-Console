# MarkBook-Console

MarkBook application built with C# for console

This is a MarkBook I built with C# for a grade 12 Computer Science assignment. This program runs fully on console. You can add students, which then places all their data in a file called "page.txt".
You can also find the students that you added, see all of them at one (student list) and also delete them.
